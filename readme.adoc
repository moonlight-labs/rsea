To convert a folder into a self-extracting archive:

ruby <archive_file> <optional_dest_folder>
```

### FEATURES

- Human editable metadata
- Handles text AND binary files

### ROADMAP

Want to contribute to a nifty little open source project? There are a few enhancements that could be made with just a couple lines of code

- Binary file detection without `mimemagic`
- Gemify this
- Allow explicit list of files as input instead of folder only
- Enable file permissions & ownership flags
- Document interpolation possibilities
- Tests could be nice
- Cross-platform executable?
